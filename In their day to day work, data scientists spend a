In their day to day work, data scientists spend a lot of time just to prepare/clean their data so that they can execute queries and extract the right portion of the data that they need for they task at hand

We argue that it would be much cheaper to clean a subset of the dataset if some hints (namely, the query) is given than blindly cleaning the entire dataset and then execute the query

So, We want to provide a tool to supporting the user to do that

Data may be affected by many errors, e.g...
Non-standardized values are very common, and often is one of the first error that we want to get rid of while cleaning the data, so we start from here
